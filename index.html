      <img src="images/elsa.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Elsa Gomez">

      <p>My name is Elsa Gomez. Born and raised in Monterrey, Mexico, I arrived to NY in 2012 to study English for one year. I fell in love with New York and decided that it was the city where I wanted to live forever. So I decided to enroll in Baruch College and get a Marketing and Finance Certificate.</p>

      <p>I graduated in 2015 and got a job in the Energy Industry, where I currently work as a Marketing Coordinator. I love Marketing, as much as I like dancing and coding. But there are other important things that I love more: my adorable nieces, my family and my boyfriend and his family.</p>
